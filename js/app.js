document.getElementById('play').addEventListener('click', (e)=>{selectedPokemon.Played()}) //when #play btn clicks bordom goes down



//Brain Dump
// Start in an egg?
// Need to tell player that if levels get to 10 they faint
// Pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, or Sleepiness hits 10.

//How to get hunger, boredom, sleepiness to go on it's own and then keep track in points. 

    // Ideas: When pokemonName alert- have some kind of timer, after x time points increase.
        // Then if they hit the button the points go down. 
            // If points are =1 message tells them they do not need to click btn atm. 
            //If points = 10 Pokemon faints - if Pokemon faints something needs to happen visually


//Increase your pet's age every x minutes set 
    // If age = x - morph aka evolve - change image to evolution 
    //Ideas:  
    // Use :
    //setTimeout(function, milliseconds)    60000 milliseconds = 1 min
    //Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
    // OR 
    //setInterval(function, milliseconds)
    //Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.

// Animate your pet across the screen while it's alive.
//Ideas:

// How does player win - Tomigatchi doesn't have winning. Its more so about keeping it alive.
